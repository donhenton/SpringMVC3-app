Running locally requires defining a system variable called
DATABASE_URL currently postgres://test:test@localhost:5433/jdatabase
this is also present in the pom.xml under the css profile as a system
variable to the jetty plugin

this is used by the spring restaurant config to load the database from
Heroku definition


to create  the db locally;
CREATE USER test WITH SUPERUSER UNENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'test'
create database jdatabase owner test; when logged in as a super user
